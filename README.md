**Problem Statement**
Our project focuses on creating a ride-sharing recommendation system to help drivers identify high-demand areas where they are most likely to get more rides. By analyzing historical ride data, we aim to predict hotspots during different times of the day and proviQde drivers with real-time suggestions on where to position themselves to increase their chances of getting a ride. This will help improve driver efficiency and reduce idle time. Additionally, we are incorporating a gender preference feature, allowing passengers to customize their ride preferences, such as sharing rides based on gender. This feature enhances user comfort and security, making the app more inclusive and user-friendly.

**Project Objective**
The primary objective is to build a ride-sharing mobile app that improves taxi efficiency while offering a safe and customizable ride experience.

**Specific Objectives:**

Analyze datasets to find an efficient ride-sharing algorithm for better ride-matching.

Develop a real-time recommendation system that directs taxis to high-demand locations.

Implement a gender-based ride-sharing preference to enhance passenger comfort.

Research and compare various ride-sharing algorithms to select the most effective one.

Build the app using C++ for backend processing and integrate it with a user-friendly interface.

Credit
This project is based on an existing open-source repository that provided a foundational simulation for ride-sharing systems. We have made significant modifications to the code, including adding features for real-time ride-matching, gender-based preferences, and more. You can find the original repository here:

SHARE
This project can be run on a city map, and we have specifically tested it using data for San Francisco (SF).
