Capstone ride sharing
A. Project Scope   
Problem statement 
Our project focuses on creating a ride-sharing recommendation system to help drivers identify high demand 
areas where they are most likely to get more rides. By analyzing historical ride data, we aim to predict hotspots 
during different times of the day and provide drivers with real-time suggestions on where to position themselves 
to increase their chances of getting a ride. This will help improve driver efficiency and reduce idle time. 
Additionally, we are incorporating a gender preference feature, allowing passengers to customize their ride 
preferences, such as sharing rides based on gender. This feature enhances user comfort and security, making 
the app more inclusive and user-friendly. 

What is our project’s objective? 
The primary objective is to build a ride-sharing mobile app that improves taxi efficiency while offering a safe 
and customizable ride experience. 
Specific Objectives:  
• Analyze datasets to find an efficient ride-sharing algorithm for better ride-matching. 
• Develop a real-time recommendation system that directs taxis to high-demand locations. 
• Implement a gender-based ride-sharing preference to enhance passenger comfort. 
• Research and compare various ride-sharing algorithms to select the most effective one. 
• Build the app using C++ for backend processing and integrate it with a user-friendly interface.
